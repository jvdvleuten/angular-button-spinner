angular-button-spinner
===========================

# Description

This is a simple directive (765 bytes when minified) to add a spinner while loading some data for user feedback. It uses font-awesome to render the spinner by default, but you can customize all classes as can be seen in the documentation.

# Usage
It can be used on every element (e.g. <a>, <button>), as an attribute.

Best results are obtained when used in combination with font-awesome and bootstrap. I recommend using it in combination with ng-disable to prevent firing multiple requests.
